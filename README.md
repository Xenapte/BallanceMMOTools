# BallanceMMOTools

Extra tools useful for managing [BallanceMMO](https://github.com/Swung0x48/BallanceMMO/) servers.

*Disclaimer*: these tools are all written by me for my personal use (in managing my own BMMO server instances), so I cannot guarantee their compatibility, portability and/or good quality of code at all. Beware of hard-coded values.

## Contents

### bmmo_reverse_proxy.js

Reverse proxy with a RESTful API for major BMMO servers.
